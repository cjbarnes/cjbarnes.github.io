York Profiles & Mentors was a particularly rewarding and enjoyable project to work on. The success of the project largely came down to the expertise and positive attitudes of the people I worked with. My lead contacts in both York Alumni Association and *Careers* were decisive, forward-thinking, and imaginative[^1]. In fact, everyone I worked with gave freely of their time and knowledge and wasn't precious about things they'd worked on in the past or 'how things are done'.

It was a pleasure to work on York Profiles & Mentors, and I'm very proud of the result. Have a look:

[^1]: Imagination is hugely underrated in web design clients. Often the client has to be able to make big decisions about how things should work without actually seeing or trying the alternatives. To do that, the client needs to take a leap of faith---unless they have the imagination to 'see' the possibilities *before* they exist as real, usable webpages.
