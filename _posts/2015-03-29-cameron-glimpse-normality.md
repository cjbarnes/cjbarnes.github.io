An excellent comment piece by David Mitchell for the *Guardian*. He wrote about David Cameron's 'gaffe' this week, when he gave a straight answer to a journalist's question about whether he would seek a third term as Prime Minister.

<figure class="quote">
> This nasty little Westminster squall is a good illustration of what’s wrong with British politics at the moment---of the tedious and irrelevant scrutiny of image and tactics that we’ve somehow adopted instead of a properly functioning political system. We get a tiny glimpse of openness and humanity, of the prime minister talking like a normal person, and it’s immediately stamped on.

I couldn't agree more, although I think Mr Mitchell is wide of the mark in putting so much blame on Douglas Alexander (the Labour shadow minister who attacked Mr Cameron's answer) while not mentioning the news media's role in stoking these sorts of controversies.

Yes, we want our politicians to 'talk like a normal human'. The problem is, **they're not talking *to* a normal human**. We see (or even worse read) a small snippet of a conversation they're having *with a journalist*---someone whose livelihood depends on generating controversy[^1].

How can a politician talk like a real human when she knows that the audience she's trying to reach will only hear a tiny fraction of what she said? When the small fragment her audience will hear is purposefully chosen because it's the worst part of what she said? When she knows that that small fragment will also be stripped of all context---even the question she was answering!---and instead framed by a new context, chosen by cynics[^2] and including a direct attack by her worst enemies?

Of course politicians don't talk like real people! Would you?

[^1]: This sounds like a ridiculous and unfair exaggeration, but I don't believe it is. By definition, news journalists write about things that are 'newsworthy'. It's not newsworthy when a public figure says something uncontroversial, answers a question well, or states the bleeding obvious. No news organization will publish the story, 'Politician says something sensible'! But if it's 'Politician says something shocking' or 'Politician says something stupid', the story gets printed, shared online, perhaps even covered on TV.

    Therefore journalists (in general; doubtless there are many exceptions) have a strong professional incentive to make things sound more controversial than they are. If it's controversial, the journalists have done their job. If it isn't, they need to find something else to write about.
    
    I'm aware that I'm ignoring the possibility that journalists' ethics restrain them from acting out of cynical self-interest. Perhaps you think I should give them the benefit of the doubt. But since journalists in general consistently refuse to grant politicians that same benefit of the doubt, why should I act any differently toward them?

[^2]: Have you ever met a news journalist who isn't a cynic? Neither have I.
