Five years of being a freelance web designer without a website have finally come to an end.
{:.lead}
<!--more-->

It's customary for a developer launching her new (or improved) website to write a helpful/self-congratulatory blog post describing the site's most interesting features. This is not one of those posts.[^1] I think what it's been like to make a website for myself is a more interesting topic than the end result is.

Although I've made dozens of websites over the last decade, this is the first site I've built entirely for myself. Being my own client has caused unique problems that I didn't anticipate when I started.

## no constraints

<figure class="quote">
> Design depends largely on constraints. [...] Here is one of the few effective keys to the Design problem: the ability of the Designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible; his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints.

TODO: Like all designers, I'm used to working within constraints (eg chess?). Brand, font, colours, tone of voice, taste of client. Even just a logo makes a huge difference to a site's appearance, layout, and tone.

## no one to please but myself

TODO (problem is, I'm never pleased with my own work!)

TODO (value of second opinions, and of client's gut reactions. Hard to evaluate your own design fairly when you've been staring at it for so long)

TODO (style - ise or ize? Oxford comma? tone of voice?)

## no deadlines

TODO

## what's the point?

TODO (web developers really ought to have websites! not just for marketing; as a playground for trying new things. eg Sass; Jekyll; client-side search)

TODO (somewhere to point people to, either to get examples of my work (*cough* [my portfolio](/whativedone/portfolio/) *cough*), info on how I work, or to answer questions I keep getting asked)

TODO (nice to have somewhere to write this stuff)

## why now?

TODO

## what I'm writing about

TODO (post formats)


[^1]: No promises that I'll stay away from such posts in future though...
