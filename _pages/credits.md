This website would not be possible without the awesome projects, images, and fonts made freely available by the lovely people mentioned on this page. If your name’s on the list, **thank you!** If it isn’t and should be, my apologies—please [contact me](mailto:mail@cjbarnes.co.uk) so I can correct my mistake.

First things first: all web design and writing on this website is by Chris Barnes (that’s me), unless otherwise stated.
