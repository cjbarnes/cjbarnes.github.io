These pages are about what it's like to work with me.

Starting work with a new web designer can be scary. The first project together is full of unknowns. So in these pages I try to **demystify the process** of creating a website with me, so you have a better idea of what to expect and when. I also outline my **skills and experience**, which can help you to see what I would bring to your project.
