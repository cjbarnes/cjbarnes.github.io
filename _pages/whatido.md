These pages are about what it's like to work with me.

Starting work with a new web designer is daunting and can feel like a step into the unknown. So in these pages I **explain the process** of creating a website with me, so you have a better idea of what to expect and when. I also outline my **skills and experience**, which can help you to see what I would bring to your project.
