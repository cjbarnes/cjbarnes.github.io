<p class="lead">My projects begin with a simple idea:</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>You don’t want a website.</strong></p>

<p>What you <em>do</em> want is better marketing, more students, more sales, easier communication, or better information management. <em>Your website is just a means to an end.</em></p>

<p>So the key to making a great website—that’s also great value for money—is understanding what the site’s purpose is. That’s our job, working together. Then it’s up to me to create a website precisely focused around that purpose.</p>

      <div class="content listing-content step-content">
        <p>I always begin by writing a <strong>specification</strong> that captures, in as much detail as possible, what exactly your website needs to do and how it should be structured. If the spec isn’t right, the final website won’t be either. So it’s important to take this time to make sure I understand all your requirements.</p>
        <p>Once we’ve agreed a spec, I give a full fixed-price quote for the project. I always stick to my quotes; if your requirements don’t change, the price won’t change either.</p>

        <p>Before starting work on your ‘proper’ website, I create some design mockups for you to choose between and comment on. Normally you get three designs, each quite different, so you have a real choice.</p>
        <p>Once you’ve picked a favourite (or asked for a mixture of the best bits of all three!), I revise that mockup based on your comments to create the final design of the website.</p>

        <p>Now it’s time for me to actually make your website. This is also when I write any new text that is needed for the site.</p>
        <p>Your website is constructed on a ‘development server’—in layman’s terms, the new website is built on a different computer to your old website. That means your old site is unaffected by the development work, and it will only be taken down when the new site is ready to launch.</p>

        <p>Websites look and work differently on different <a href="http://www.whatbrowser.org" title="What browser am I using?">web browsers</a> and devices. So before launching your website, I test it on every commonly-used web browser and a range of mobile phones and tablets, to make sure it works well and looks good everywhere.</p>
        <p>This is also when <em>you</em> get to test your website and feed back to me with any changes you’d like me to make.</p>

        <p>The big day! Once you’ve approved the website, we can make it visible to the public (and search engines like Google). This is also when we start counting visitors to your website.</p>
        <p>If you have an old website that should be replaced by your new one, I can book in your launch for an evening or weekend to minimize disruption to your users.</p>

        <p>When I quote for projects, I always include <strong>one year’s technical support</strong>. This means I’m there to fix any bugs and help you if you get stuck with using your website.</p>
        <p>Most of my clients choose to extend the support contract once the year runs out. If you’d like to do that, I’m happy to keep supporting your website for as long as it’s in use.</p>
