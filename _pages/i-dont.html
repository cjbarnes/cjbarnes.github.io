  <p class="lead">I’ve been a client too.</p>

  <p>I spent many years managing talented designers and developers. I know what I loved about these experiences, and what I hated.</p>

  <p>From this, what I bring to my website projects is <strong>empathy</strong>. I know what would frustrate you and what would make you feel great about our working relationship.</p>

  <p>I’ve listed here the things I hated most as a client and what I do instead. This is my ‘Don’ts List’. I’m determined to avoid these mistakes in every part of my work.</p>

        <p>My websites run on <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, which is a simple website editing system—no expertise or software required. So <strong>you can update your own website</strong> without paying me anything.</p>
        <p>You’ll be able to edit all text on your site, add and remove webpages, change menus, create and delete users, and reset passwords. You’ll get step-by-step instruction guides for all these tasks and more, tailored to your specific website.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>My websites always work well and look good on phones, tablets, and computers.</p>
        <p>That’s because I use <strong>responsive web design</strong>, which is a technique for making websites that smoothly adapt to whatever size of screen you’re using. (The <a href="http://mediaqueri.es">Media Queries website</a> and <a href="http://responsivedesign.is/examples">Responsive Design knowledge hub</a> have lots of examples of responsive web design to look at.)</p>

        <p><strong>No-one can guarantee you’ll be near the top of a Google search.</strong> (Anyone who tells you they can is either mistaken or plans to ‘cheat’ the Google rankings, which usually ends up with your site being blocked altogether.)</p>
        <p>What I <em>can</em> do is use <em>search engine optimization</em> (SEO) so your website ‘looks its best’ from Google’s perspective. I also give simple advice on the ethical and safe things you can do to improve your Google rankings.</p>

        <p><strong>I don’t use lock-in to keep clients.</strong> My websites are based around commonly-used technologies like <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, so any good web developer can work on them.</p>
        <p>You own the code and have all the passwords you need, so you can take your website to another developer any time you want. (My job is to be so good that you don’t ever want to!)</p>

        <p>My first step for new projects is to spend time with you to understand your organization, your needs, and your users and <em>their</em> needs. So even if I don’t understand your business yet, once you become my client, I <em>will</em> understand it.</p>
