My name is Chris Barnes. I'm an independent web designer/developer based in Yorkshire and East Anglia, UK.

I have specialist understanding of the online needs of schools, colleges, universities, and careers advisers. These specialisms have developed through years of experience working with careers services and every level of education provider from reception to postgraduate.

## side projects

When I'm not working, you can often find me in front of a computer anyway, fiddling with new technologies or personal projects (such as this website).

If you're technically minded, you can have a peek at some of my code in [my GitHub repos](https://github.com/cjbarnes/ "Find me on GitHub")---including the code for this website. Some of my GitHub projects are works-in-progress, so expect some rough edges!
