My name is Chris Barnes. I'm an independent web designer/developer based in Yorkshire and East Anglia, UK.

I have specialist understanding of the online needs of schools, colleges, universities, and careers advisers. These specialisms have developed through years of experience working with careers services and every level of education provider from reception to postgraduate.

## work history

As well as my freelance work, I have ten years' experience working on education-related websites, including:

- **project manager for Norfolk Education**, responsible for [Help You Choose](http://www.helpyouchoose.org), Norfolk's highly regarded 14–19 Prospectus and online admissions website used by all local sixth forms, colleges and training providers
- **web designer at the [University of York](http://www.yorkspace.net "YorkSpace, the University of York's alumni and giving website")**, responsible for websites for the alumni and fundraising teams
- **web lead for a [Connexions careers service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connexions_(agency) "Wikipedia entry on Connexions")**, creating and managing information and advice websites for 13–19s and their parents.

## education history

In 2014, I completed a **BA (Hons) Politics at the [University of York](http://www.york.ac.uk/ "University of York website")** as a mature student, graduating with a First Class Honours with Distinction.

This recent experience of life as a student has made a big difference to how I approach education-related websites---I'm more aware of the needs and wants of students as well as the priorities and challenges facing universities.

Before studying at York, I completed a **Certificate of Business Studies at [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/ "Open University website")**. Online and distance learning is becoming increasingly important to universities and colleges, so I'm grateful that I've had the opportunity to experience it for myself.

## side projects

When I'm not working, you can often find me in front of a computer anyway, fiddling with new technologies or personal projects (such as this website).

If you're technically minded, you can have a peek at some of my code in [my GitHub repos](https://github.com/cjbarnes/ "Find me on GitHub")---including the code for this website. Some of my GitHub projects are works-in-progress, so expect some rough edges!
