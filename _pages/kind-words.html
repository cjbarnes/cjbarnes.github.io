<p>I worked closely with Chris for four months and was very happy with the quality of his work, his attention to detail, dedication and reliability.</p>
<p>Chris is genuine and personable. He also has a thoughtful, user-focused approach to content, understanding how people are likely to read and understand it and therefore the most effective way to present it to them.</p>
